# 🚀 API Learning Journey

## 📚 Complete API Curriculum - From Zero to Hero

Welcome to your comprehensive API learning environment! This curriculum takes you from absolute beginner to advanced API developer.

## 🎯 Learning Path Overview

### **Phase 1: Foundations (Lessons 1-3)**
- What are APIs and why they matter
- HTTP fundamentals (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Status codes, headers, and request/response structure
- Using tools like curl and Postman

### **Phase 2: Python API Consumption (Lessons 4-6)**
- Making API calls with `requests` library
- Handling JSON data and responses
- Error handling and authentication
- Working with real APIs (weather, news, etc.)

### **Phase 3: Building APIs (Lessons 7-9)**
- Creating REST APIs with Flask
- Database integration
- API design principles and best practices
- Testing your APIs

### **Phase 4: Advanced Topics (Lessons 10-12)**
- Authentication and security
- Rate limiting and caching
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Deployment and monitoring

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

1. **Understand** what APIs are and how they work
2. **Consume** third-party APIs in Python applications
3. **Build** your own REST APIs with proper design
4. **Test** APIs thoroughly and handle errors gracefully
5. **Secure** APIs with authentication and best practices
6. **Deploy** APIs to production environments
7. **Document** APIs for other developers to use

## 🤝 Real-World Applications

You'll build practical projects like:
- Weather dashboard consuming weather APIs
